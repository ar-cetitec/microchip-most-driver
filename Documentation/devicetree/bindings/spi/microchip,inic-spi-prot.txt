Microchip INIC SPI protocol driver


Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "microchip,inic-spi-prot".

- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that services
  interrupts for this device.

- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
  depends on the interrupt controller.

- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI clock frequency of the device in Hz as
  described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt


Example:

&spi0 {
        status = "okay";
        protocol-driver {
                compatible = "microchip,inic-spi-prot";
                reg = <0>;
                interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
                interrupts = <0 58 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
        };
};
