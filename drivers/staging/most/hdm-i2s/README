                 I2S Hardware Dependent Module(HDM) - 0.4.0
                 ==========================================

History of Changes
==================

    0.4.0  Moved user configurable parameters from debugfs to standard mostcore path
    0.3.1  Improved compatibility with mostcore API
    0.3.0  Adapted for Mostcore version 4.0.7
    0.2.0  Adapted for Mostcore version 4.0.4
    0.1.0  Initial Internal Release (Tested with OS81110)

Module Description
==================

    The HDM provides access to I2S Interface through Mostcore.
    It registers the I2S as a MOST interface to Mostcore and send/receive
    packets from/to Mostcore.

    This version contains the following files,

        1.README         - This file
        2.Makefile       - Kernel modules make file
        3.hdm_i2s.c      - HDM
        4.hdm_i2s.h      - Header file
        5.configure.sh   - A script to configure I2S parameters


    Current implementation supports up to 8 I2S channels at any given time.

How To Build
============

    To cross compile the Module, you need to have toolchain for the specific
    hardware platform. If Mostcore is not already integrated into the kernel,
    HDM needs to be build with Mostcore(HDM Makefile expects mostcore diretory
    to be present in the parent directory).

    Command to build the Module,
    make ARCH=<arch> CROSS_COMPILE=<cross compiler> KDIR=<kernel source dir>

    Example for make (may differ from your configuration):
    make ARCH=arm KDIR=/home/ubuntu/arwen/linux-xlnx-xilinx-v14.7 \
       CROSS_COMPILE=/home/ubuntu/arwen/arm-2013.11/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

    After build process completed, the current directory will contain all the
    builded modules (mostcore.ko, hdm_i2s.ko).

How To Run
==========

    1) Load Mostcore  and hdm (using "insmod") in the following order,

        insmod mostcore.ko
        insmod hdm_i2s.ko

    2) Configure I2S parameters (see "How to configure" section)

Integration into BSP
====================

    This module can be integrated into any Linux BSP. The module was tested with
    Linux Kernel v3.0.35 and Mostcore 4.0.7. HDM expects DTS information to be
    available inside kernel for the configuration of hardware specific
    settings in HDM.

    The module was tested on Arwen platform MSF-BSP version V1.1.0
    Device Tree Version: Xilinx EDK 2013.2 EDK_P.68d

How to configure
================

This module builds a sysfs infrastructure to configure the I2S interface:

    # find /sys/devices/virtual/most/mostcore/devices/mdev1/bus -printf "%M %p\n"
    drwxr-xr-x /sys/devices/virtual/most/mostcore/devices/mdev1/bus
    -rw-rw-rw- /sys/devices/virtual/most/mostcore/devices/mdev1/bus/port_a_enable

    -rw-rw-rw- /sys/devices/virtual/most/mostcore/devices/mdev1/bus/port_b_data_format


"configure.sh" script contains the supported values for all parameters.
The script also contains some example configurations.

Important Note: Write 1 to "bus_enable" after configuring all other parameters.

To configure a specific configuration run the script as,

   ./configure.sh <configuration_option>

   ( ex: ./configure.sh left_64fs_16bit )

    Following configuration options are currently available,
    (The script can be extended to support more configurations)

    delay_64fs_16bit
    left_64fs_16bit
    right_64fs_16bit
    delay_64fs_seq
    delay_128fs_seq
    delay_256fs_seq
    delay_512fs_seq
    seq_64fs
    seq_128fs
    seq_256fs
    seq_512fs

    Important Note: The application must configure the buffer size as 2044 bytes
