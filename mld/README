HISTORY OF CHANGES
==================

mld-next
--------

- add driver and the make example for the SPI interface

- core: the autoconf feature is moved from the source code to the patch
  mld/patches/feature__core_autoconf.patch
  (it makes no difference for the users of the script fetch-mld.bash as it
  applies the patch automatically)


mld-1.6.0
---------

- dim2: enabled flow control for the isochronous channels

- net: fixed race between the create/destroy/use of the device

- removed dependency of HDM's on the networking-aim
  (networking-aim must not be loaded if not used)

- net: added carrier information based on the NI state
  ('ip link' shows different status depending on the MOST lock state,
  see also /sys/class/net/meth0/carrier)

- net: added use of the operational state 'dormant'
  (net device starts successfully even without valid MAC address,
  the property /sys/class/net/meth0/operstate varies between 'down', 'dormant'
  and 'up')

- usb: fixed calculation of the final buffer size for the streaming channels in
  the case where the buffer size is near to the 64K bytes

- usb: fixed calculation of the final buffer size for the streaming channels in
  the case where the buffer size is corrected by the driver down to the next
  appropriate for the hardware value


mld-1.5.0
---------

- core: added automatic configuration ability, that allows to create the
  configurations to automate and speed up the appearance of the devices
- cdev-aim: the character device is destroyed by the disconnecting the channel,
  i.e. the re-appeared channel may be immediately re-linked to the cdev with
  the same name even if the application holds the file handle of the previous
  character device


mld-1.4.0
---------

- usb-hdm: fixed synchronization procedure for the asynchronous endpoints
- networking-aim: to prevent the non-standard behavior, the networking startup
  call (ifup) remains blocked until the networking interface receives a valid
  MAC address from the INIC (commit 3c3f3af938cd)
- networking-aim: fixed startup of the networking interfaces based on the
  MediaLB and start before the MOST ring is locked (commit 1396c3de7053)
- dim2-hdm: added monitoring of the used Async Tx DBR memory as a workaround
  for the issue, where the Sync channel duplicates the packets while the Async
  channel has the traffic.  This change needs the configured interrupt mlb_int
  additional to ahb0_int in the device tree. (commit f40841ab035c)
- dim2-hdm: increased DBR size of the Control and Async Tx channels to double
  of configured buffer size to improve the throughput of the transmitted
  over the MediaLB messages
- core: the properties add_link and remove_link made write-only
- core: added read-only property 'links' that shows all linked to the AIM
  channels (without link parameters)
- core: the property set_datatype accepts also 'isoc' and returns 'isoc'
  instead of 'isoc_avp'
- core: the property set_direction accepts also 'tx' and 'rx' and returns 'tx'
  and 'rx' instead of correspondingly 'dir_tx' and 'dir_rx'
- core: the properties available_datatypes and available_directions return text
  instead of binary content and may be grep'd now
- cdev-aim: writing for streaming channels (sync/isoc) made possible using the
  buffer of any size.  This allows to use the redirection like
  'cat stream >/dev/mdev0-ca12' instead of 'dd'.
- i2s-hdm: added I2S HDM
- made a lot of diverse code improvements


mld-1.3.12
----------

- usb-hdm: added support for USB gadget OS81210
- usb-hdm: added arbitrary access to DCI registers
- usb-hdm: added possibility to internally sync the endpoint logic of the
  controller
- made diverse code improvements


1.3.11
------

- dim2-hdm: fixed random data at the beginning of the synchronous streams
- networking-aim: fixed interrupt unsafe spinlocks that may be the reason of
  the kernel hang


1.3.10
------

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash possible by closing the USB channel while traffic
- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash due to the race in the handling of the endpoint
  stall condition
- dim2-hdm: fixed kernel freeze possible when reusing the dim2 channel
- v4l2-aim: fixed kernel crash due to interrupt unsafe spinlocks
- v4l2-aim: assigned different names for the different devices (video devices
  get the hardware dependent names and the V4L devices names may be set
  using the driver configuration which is similar to the cdev-aim)


1.3.9
-----

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash appeared when closing the active channel
- dim2-hdm: added possibility to configure the parameter (fcnt) representing
  the number of frames per internal DIM2 sub-buffer for synchronous channels


1.3.8
-----

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash caused by the wrong handling of the endpoint
  stall condition (regression in the version 1.3.7)
- dim2-hdm: fixed race by closing the DIM2 channel


1.3.7
-----

- usb-hdm: added product id for OS81119
- usb-hdm: fixed handling of the endpoint stall condition
- made diverse code improvements

- core: fixed potential minor number leak
- core: fixed issues by removing the link to channel
- aim-cdev: fixed races by closing the channels
- aim-cdev: fixed potential MBO leak
- aim-cdev: poll: fixed issue with waking the sleeping process
- aim-network: added rx_dropped statistics
- made diverse code improvements

- made diverse small code improvements


1.3.2
-----

- fixed sync request (over USB interface) for OS81118 Rev.D
- fixed multi-AIM support
  (simultaneous MEP/MDP is possible)
- made diverse small code improvements

known issues

- arbitration for simultaneous MEP/MDP is not fair


1.3.1
-----

changes

- fixed 1.3.0 regression: babble on in pipe of USB-HDM
  (fixes synchronous and isochronous Rx over USB)

- fixed spin_lock/spin_unlock unmatching by unloading V4L-AIM
- fixed MAC address representation for PCIe-INIC

  (no crash by opening device exact after registering)

- USB-HDM is not working properly in virtual environment
  (babble on IN pipe)
